# REPOSITORY UPDATES
13 Aug 2023
I've been meaning to have this up when I created this repository. There are some coding errors in some of the scripts that
I need to correct. Once I've correct the errors, I will add an update.

# My Dotfiles
These are my # linux.sh
This script checks to see if the Linux operating system is installed and reports
an error message is Linux is not installled.

# cleanup.sh
This script removes what work that is done in the linux.sh script
.dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.

# .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.

# .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.

# linux.sh
This script checks to see if the Linux operating system is installed and reports
an error message is Linux is not installled.

# cleanup.sh
This script removes what work that is done in the linux.sh script.

# Makefile
The file runs the linux.sh script and the cleanup.sh script.
